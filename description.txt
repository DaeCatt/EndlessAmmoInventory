EndlessAmmoInventory adds a new item crafted at the Crystal Ball using an Endless Musket Pouch and an Endless Quiver to unlock a part of the inventory to manage Endless Ammo.

The Endless Ammo inventory can be used to convert any common consumable ammo (bullets, arrows, rockets, or solutions) in the game (except seeds) into a permanently unlocked endless ammo.
Ammo provided by other mods should be supported, but has not been thoroughly tested.
